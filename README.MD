Unity project files for my 2024 Cloud Computing project using AWS GameLift.

Note that there's some stuff ommitted for this public version of the repo such as IAM credentials to avoid the annoying github repo scraping bot spam as well as package paths for privacy. Too lazy to filter the real repository.
